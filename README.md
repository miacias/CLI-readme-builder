# CLI-readme-builder

## Description

  The motivation behind building this project was simple: alongside every repository and coding project is its README.md file. The end goal of the CLI-readme-builder is to make this process simpler and less tedious. In making this project, I learned the value of using JavaScript Promises as well as their setbacks. Initially, the Inquirer package was used in a single function to collect all information, however as the app grew to be more complex, using promises became combersome since they are asynchronous yet used synchronously in this project. Despite the learning curve of using a new technology, the app is fully functional and can help developers at any level get started on building an effective README.
